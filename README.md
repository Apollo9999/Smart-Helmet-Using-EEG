Project Objective is to develop and design a prototype BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE solution which can enhance cricketers performance A lot of players work hard but sometimes they do not perform as expected at the match day due to performance anxiety ,mental trauma .Hence our team decided to make a brain computer interface model that can read how a player's mind operates and observations made at certain situations .The prototype shown in this “project will be an input for cricket coaches , physical trainers etc.. consider the aspects of player training to ensure better coordination and management.The main intent of the project is to collect various EEG data from player and know how would a particular player react to a certain situation and further will help in improving his/her weaknesses . We can also build a smart helmet that can track players through out the match .To accomplish this task, it is necessary to build a circuit that could amplify and filter an EEG signal, which could then be read by an Arduino microcontroller.With inclusion of Brain Computer Interface in cricket the game is gonna really raise the standards of sports .Due to these High tech gadgets we can improve players mentally as well as physically .

Technology Stack

Project built with circuit over NI Multisim14.2 for EEG System over this month (approx) but due to time factor and fund factor can’t create it completely over hardware but certainly innovation like smart EEG helmets will be the Future Of Cricket





The Intent and motive  of the project is to keenly observe and applying Data Intelligence insights so as to attain the best performance of the cricket player:
